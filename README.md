# About🆔 

## Who am I?

I am Natalie Perret, a Software Developer, currently based in Paris. 

## Some additional bits about myself

- I like to talk and write about mental health, work, and software development.
- I am working with F#, C# (marginally), TypeScript and Rust (with parsimony) stuff at work.
- I am currently learning Rust (cause I am clearly not an expert), Go (re-learning it cause I wanna help with it at work), TypeScript (not doing great) and Zig (my own quirks).
- You can probably ask my help about .NET, C# or F#.
- You can find some marginal activity of mine on:
